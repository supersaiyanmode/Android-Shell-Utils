SETUP

0) Root your phone. Set up adb on your machine.

1) Open up the terminal on your phone. Take some pain to type the following:

	su
	setprop service.adb.tcp.port 5555
	stop adbd
	start adbd

   Now to connect to your phone via adb:
 
	adb connect <ip-of-phone>:5555

LAZY-TIP #1: Make a phone call

Open your terminal and run the following command:

	android-call 987654321       # The script prefixes +91 for you.


====================================================

LAZY-TIP #2: Check your notifications

Open your terminal and run:

	android-shownotifications

The above script assumes a command "open" exists, and takes a file path as a parameter and opens the associated application. Basically, this opens your image viewer application to show you the screen capture of your notification bar.
