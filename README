SETUP

0) Root your phone. Set up adb on your machine. Put all the scripts somewhere in your $PATH

1) Open up the terminal on your phone. Take some pain to type the following:

	su
	setprop service.adb.tcp.port 5555
	stop adbd
	start adbd

   Now to connect to your phone via adb:
 
	adb connect <ip-of-phone>:5555

====================================================

LAZY-TIP #1: Make a phone call

Open your terminal and run the following command:

	android-call 987654321       # The script prefixes +91 for you.


====================================================

LAZY-TIP #2: Check your notifications

Open your terminal and run:

	android-shownotifications

The above script assumes a command called "open" exists. On OSX, "open" would take a file path
and open it with the registered application. Basically, this is to launch some image viewer
application to present the screenshot of your notification bar.
